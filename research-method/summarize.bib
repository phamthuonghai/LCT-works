abstract = {Twitter as a new form of social media can potentially con-tain much useful information, but content analysis on Twitter has not been well studied. In particular, it is not clear whether as an information source Twitter can be simply regarded as a faster news feed that covers mostly the same information as traditional news media. In This paper we empirically compare the content of Twitter with a traditional news medium, New York Times, using unsupervised topic modeling. We use a Twitter-LDA model to discover topics from a representative sample of the entire Twitter. We then use text mining techniques to compare these Twitter topics with topics from New York Times, taking into considera-tion topic categories and types. We also study the relation between the proportions of opinionated tweets and retweets and topic categories and types. Our comparisons show interesting and useful findings for down-stream IR or DM applications.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of identifying influential users of micro-blogging services. Twitter, one of the most notable micro-blogging services, employs a social-networking model called “following”, in which each user can choose who she wants to “follow” to receive tweets from without requir- ing the latter to give permission first. In a dataset prepared for this study, it is observed that (1) 72.4{\{}{\%}{\}} of the users in Twitter follow more than 80{\{}{\%}{\}} of their followers, and (2) 80.5{\{}{\%}{\}} of the users have 80{\{}{\%}{\}} of users they are following follow them back. Our study reveals that the presence of “reciprocity” can be explained by phenomenon of homophily [14]. Based on this finding, TwitterRank, an extension of PageRank algorithm, is proposed to measure the influence of users in Twitter. TwitterRank measures the influence taking both the topical similarity between users and the link struc- ture into account. Experimental results show that Twit- terRank outperforms the one Twitter currently uses and other related algorithms, including the original PageRank and Topic-sensitive PageRank.},

abstract = {Twitter, or the world of 140 characters poses serious challenges to the efficacy of topic models on short, messy text. While topic mod-els such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have a long history of successful application to news articles and academic abstracts, they are often less coherent when applied to microblog content like Twitter. In this paper, we investigate methods to improve topics learned from Twitter content without modifying the basic machin-ery of LDA; we achieve this through various pooling schemes that aggregate tweets in a data preprocessing step for LDA. We empir-ically establish that a novel method of tweet pooling by hashtags leads to a vast improvement in a variety of measures for topic co-herence across three diverse Twitter datasets in comparison to an unmodified LDA baseline and a variety of pooling schemes. An additional contribution of automatic hashtag labeling further im-proves on the hashtag pooling results for a subset of metrics. Over-all, these two novel schemes lead to significantly improved LDA topic models on Twitter content.},

abstract = {Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a topic model that has been applied to var-ious fields, including user profiling and event summarization on Twitter. When LDA is applied to tweet collections, it gen-erally treats all aggregated tweets of a user as a single document. Twitter-LDA, which assumes a single tweet consists of a single topic, has been proposed and has shown that it is superior in topic semantic coher-ence. However, Twitter-LDA is not capa-ble of online inference. In this study, we extend Twitter-LDA in the following two ways. First, we model the generation pro-cess of tweets more accurately by estimat-ing the ratio between topic words and gen-eral words for each user. Second, we en-able it to estimate the dynamics of user in-terests and topic trends online based on the topic tracking model (TTM), which mod-els consumer purchase behaviors.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the attributes and relative inﬂuence of 1.6M Twitter users by tracking 74 million diﬀusion events that took place on the Twitter follower graph over a two month interval in 2009. Unsurprisingly, we ﬁnd that the largest cascades tend to be generated by users who have been inﬂuential in the past and who have a large number of followers. We also ﬁnd that URLs that were rated more interesting and/or elicited more positive feelings by workers on Mechanical Turk were more likely to spread. In spite of these intuitive results, however, we ﬁnd that predictions of which particular user or URL will generate large cascades are relatively unreliable. We conclude, therefore, that word-of-mouth diﬀusion can only be harnessed reliably by targeting large numbers of potential inﬂuencers, thereby capturing average eﬀects. Finally, we consider a family of hypothetical marketing strategies, deﬁned by the relative cost of identifying versus compensating potential “inﬂuencers.” We ﬁnd that although under some circumstances, the most inﬂuential users are also the most cost-eﬀective, under a wide range of plausible assumptions the most cost-eﬀective performance can be realized using “ordinary inﬂuencers”— individuals who exert average or even less-than-average inﬂuence.},

@article{Fang2014,
abstract = {Social media is emerging as a new mainstream means of interacting around online media. Social influence mining in social networks is therefore of critical importance in real-world applications such as friend suggestion and photo recommendation. Social media is inherently multimodal, including rich types of user contributed content and social link information. Most of the existing research suffers from two limitations: 1){\&}{\#}x00A0;only utilizing the textual information, and/or 2){\&}{\#}x00A0;only analyzing the generic influence but ignoring the more important topic-level influence. To address these limitations, in this paper we develop a novel Topic-Sensitive Influencer Mining (TSIM) framework in interest-based social media networks. Specifically, we take Flickr as the study platform. People in Flickr interact with each other through images. TSIM aims to find topical influential users and images. The influence estimation is determined with a hypergraph learning approach. In the hypergraph, the vertices represent users and images, and the hyperedges are utilized to capture multi-type relations including visual-textual content relations among images, and social links between users and images. Algorithmwise, TSIM first learns the topic distribution by leveraging user-contributed images, and then infers the influence strength under different topics for each node in the hypergraph. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of more than 50{\&}{\#}x00A0;K images and 70{\&}{\#}x00A0;K comment/favorite links from Flickr have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. In addition, we also report promising results of friend suggestion and photo recommendation via TSIM on the same dataset.},

abstract = {In the original PageRank algorithm for improving the rank-ing of search-query results, a single PageRank vector is com-puted, using the link structure of the Web, to capture the relative " importance " of Web pages, independent of any par-ticular search query. To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased us-ing a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. For ordi-nary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive Page-Rank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared.},

abstract = {Microblogging platforms, such as Twitter, already play an important role in cultural, social and political events around the world. Discovering high-level topics from social streams is therefore important for many downstream applications. However, traditional text mining methods that rely on the bag-of-words model are insuﬃcient to uncover the rich se- mantics and temporal aspects of topics in Twitter. In par- ticular, topics in Twitter are inherently dynamic and often focus on speciﬁc entities, such as people or organizations. In this paper, we therefore propose a method for mining multi- faceted topics from Twitter streams. The Multi-Faceted Topic Model (MfTM) is proposed to jointly model latent semantics among terms and entities and captures the tem- poral characteristics of each topic. We develop an eﬃcient online inference method for MfTM, which enables our model to be applied to large-scale and streaming data. Our exper- imental evaluation shows the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of our model compared with state-of-the-art baselines. We fur- ther demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our framework in the context of tweet clustering.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics.

In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document.

# UPPERCASE

* Use a large neural network
* Regularization: dropout
* Normalization: batch normalization, layer normalization
* Adam with increasing learning rate the decreasing

# MNIST_COMPETITION

* 5x5 convolution with stride 2
* Bunch of convolution and max-pooling layers

# FASHION_MASKS

* Up-scaling with convolution

# NSKETCH_TRANSFER
* inception_v3, vgg16 as features
* use small learning rate when tuning or else the a big drop
